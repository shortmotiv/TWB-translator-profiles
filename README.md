# TWB translator profiles

Serve the page and open in browser. The site will automatically have fetched some data from the profile links already set in the code. Modify the code to add/remove a profile.

The page may take some time to load since there are slight, random delays between hits to different profiles.

To serve, you can use the PHP [built-in web server](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php#example-410):
```
cd ~/path/to/TWB-translator-profiles
php -S localhost:8000
```
